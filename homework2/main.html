            <h4>The Goals</h4>
            <p>
                This week is JavaScript week. We are to get comfortable with JavaScript and jQuery. At the same time we
                are supposed to be learning about branching with git. I am going to start with git. Time to create a
                new branch.
            </p>
            <h4>But first: Keys please</h4>
            <p>
                I mentioned in my last post that I was having to enter my ssh passphrase on every git action that
                communitcated with the remote service. This was annoying. I decided that I had enough time to take a
                detour and fix that problem. I had my key created, signed and in github i just needed it in my local
                ssh agent store. Last week I got the agent running but I had no idea how close was to getting the key
                in the store. All I had to do was run <code>ssh-add -k</code> and enter my passphrase. Now my
                passphrase is remembered it's time to continue on with the assignment.
            </p>
            <h4>Ok, seriously time for a branch</h4>
            <p>
                Branching is very straight forward. I went to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm</a> website
                and read their sections on branching. I took a peak at the section on merging too while I was there.
                With that done, I ran the following commands to get my workspace setup.
            </p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
                            $ git branch homework2
                            $ git checkout homework2
                            $ git push origin homework2
                    </code></pre>
            </div>
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
                I spent some time thinking about what I could do with jQuery. Naturally all of my first ideas where
                pretty funny. Then I thought of something useful. The most error prone part of this class so far is
                putting together these blog posts. Maybe I could make that a little easier on myself? I decided I was
                going to make myself a tool that I could use to write this posts and do some basic formatting on them.
                Then I was going to create an export tool so I can create the post there and simply copy and past my
                post into this html file. The following marks the point at which I switched over to the tool I created.
                If there is nothing after the line, I have clearly failed.
