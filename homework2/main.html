            <h4>The Goals</h4>
            <p>
                This assignment we are to become familiar with Git using the command line. In order to get there we are
                to create a new repo using the command line. After that we will build a static website to demonstrate
                our ability to use HTML/CSS and bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with the repo will allow me to make commits as I put together my static page. I'll have a
                chance to practice my command line skills. Lets begin.
            </p>
            <h4>But first: Keys please</h4>
            <p>
                I mentioned in my last post that I was having to enter my ssh passphrase on every git action that
                communitcated with the remote service. This was annoying. I decided that I had enough time to take a
                detour and fix up that problem. I had my key created, signed and in github i just needed it in my local
                ssh agent store. Last week I got the agent running but I had no idea how close was to getting the key
                in the store. All I had to do was run <code>ssh-add -k</code> and enter my passphrase. Now my
                passphrase is remembered it's time to continue on with the assignment.
