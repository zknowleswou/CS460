            <h4>The Goals</h4>
            <p>
                This week is JavaScript week. We are to get comfortable with JavaScript and jQuery. At the same time we
                are supposed to be learning about branching with git. I am going to start with git. Time to create a
                new branch.
            </p>
            <h4>But first: Keys please</h4>
            <p>
                I mentioned in my last post that I was having to enter my ssh passphrase on every git action that
                communitcated with the remote service. This was annoying. I decided that I had enough time to take a
                detour and fix that problem. I had my key created, signed and in github i just needed it in my local
                ssh agent store. Last week I got the agent running but I had no idea how close was to getting the key
                in the store. All I had to do was run <code>ssh-add -k</code> and enter my passphrase. Now my
                passphrase is remembered it's time to continue on with the assignment.
            </p>
            <h4>Ok, seriously time for a branch</h4>
            <p>
                Branching is very straight forward. I went to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git-scm</a> website
                and read their sections on branching. I took a peak at the section on merging too while I was there.
                With that done, I ran the following commands to get my workspace setup.
            </p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
                            $ git branch homework2
                            $ git checkout homework2
                            $ git push origin homework2
                    </code></pre>
            </div>
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
                I spent some time thinking about what I could do with jQuery. Naturally all of my first ideas where
                pretty funny. Then I thought of something useful. The most error prone part of this class so far is
                putting together these blog posts. Maybe I could make that a little easier on myself? I decided I was
                going to make myself a tool that I could use to write these posts and do some basic formatting on them.
                Then I was going to create an export tool so I can create the post there and simply copy and paste my
                post into this html file. The following marks the point at which I switched over to the tool I created.
                If there is nothing after the line, I have clearly failed.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Hello, world!</h4>
            <p>This is my first attempt at using my new tool. I am going to leave it exactly how it comes in the blog
                post. Poor formatting or any other issues will be left in. However, you the reader may get lucky and I
                might have done a pretty good job on the first pass.

                Lets take a look and see how we got here:</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
createHeader: function () {
        var elementId = elementStore.createElement("header");
        var html = `
    &lt;div id="element_${elementId}" class="card"&gt;
            &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
                &lt;h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted"&gt;Heading&lt;/h6&gt;
                &lt;textarea id="element_${elementId}_val" style="width:100%;"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    `;

        $("#buildElementList").append(html);
        $(`#element_${elementId}_val`).focus();
    },
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>This function is a property of my <code>elementBuilder</code> object. It lives inside the <code>builder.js</code>
                file. The <code>elementBuilder</code> contains templates for each of the elements i have available on
                my build button bar. When one of the buttons is clicked the <code>elementBuilder</code> makes a call to
                <code>elementStore</code> to get an id for the element and store that id for later use.

                Let's break here and see how the tool works. I will make some tweaks if it has issues and add a few
                more features.</p>
            <div>
                <img src="./blogbuilder1.PNG" style="width:100%;">
            </div>
            <h4>Discoveries!</h4>
            <p>My first pass worked a lot better than expected. I did notice a few things that I wanted to improve.
                First, line endings are not saved on the paragraph elements. This is ok because I can just create a new
                <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> if I want a new line. A bigger issue was being able to go back and edit my work
                if needed.</p>
            <p>I decided I was going to use <code>localStorage</code> and started work on that. I quickly found that
                local storage does not work for websites loaded as files from the filesystem. Not a problem though. A
                simple import/export system will work just fine. Let's take a look at how I implemented that.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
    &lt;div id="importExportPanel" class="row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-lg-12"&gt;
            &lt;h3 style="display:inline-block;margin-right: 50px;"&gt;Import/Export&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;div style="display: inline-block;text-align: right;"&gt;
                &lt;button id="exportBtn" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" style="margin-right:30px;"&gt;Export&lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;button id="importBtn" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm"&gt;Import&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="col-lg-12"&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="importExportValue" style="width:100%;min-height:50vh;"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
    exportWorkspace: function () {
        var workspaceString = JSON.stringify(this.createElementArray());
        $("#importExportValue").val(workspaceString);
    }
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It was very simple to export my current workspace. I was already storing a representation of the blog
                post in an array. So all I had to do was get the array and call <code>JSON.stringyfy()</code>.</p>
            <h4>Where are the values?</h4>
            <p>Oops. I was not storing the values of each element in my array. That's ok though, I used a very simple
                element id pattern so it was easy to fetch using the jQuery selector.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
    createElementArray: function () {
        var elementArray = [];
        this.elements.forEach(element =&gt; {
            elementArray.push({
                type: element.type,
                value: $(`#element_${element.elementId}_val`).val()
            });
        });

        return elementArray;
    }
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <h4>What about the import?</h4>
            <p>I can now save my workspace in a text file. What about when I want to open it up and make some changes?
                This required a little bit more work. It was not too bad though, I was already using functions to
                create my elements. I just needed to use those functions again. One change I had to make was to have my
                create element functions return the element id so that i could use a selector to set its value.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
    importWorkspace: function () {
        var importString = $("#importExportValue").val();
        if (importString.length === 0 || importString === "[]")
            return;

        $("#buildElementList").html("");    
        var workspace = JSON.parse(importString);

        this.elements = [];

        workspace.forEach(element =&gt; {
            var elementId = elementBuilder.createElement(element.type);
            console.log(elementId);
            $(`#element_${elementId}_val`).val(element.value);
        });

        $("#buildBtn").click();
    }
</code></pre>
                <div>
                    <img src="./blogbuilder2.PNG" style="width:100%;margin-top: 50px;margin-bottom: 50px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Navigation</h4>
            <p>Navigation was done using simple hide/show calls on content <code>div</code>s. I added in add/remove
                class calls on the tab navigation too. This logic lives in my <code>events.js</code> file.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
    $("#buildBtn").on("click", function () {
        $("#buildPanel").show();
        $("#buildBtn").addClass("active");

        $("#rawPanel").hide();
        $("#rawBtn").removeClass("active");

        $("#importExportPanel").hide();
        $("#importExportBtn").removeClass("active");
    })
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>There is some code duplication in there, but for a project this small we are going to let that go.</p>
            <h4>Did I cover everything?</h4>
            <p>No, I did not. There is a lot to cover and I just wanted to go over some of the more important items in
                detail. Here is a list of things, which I have to make by hand because I didnt include a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
                template, that I skipped.</p>
            <div>
                <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Styles - I didn't do much styling. Just a little to move things around.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Click events - Really simple. Just hooked them on pageload in <code>events.js</code></li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">OOP JS - I used a basic singleton object design e.g. <code>var elementStore = {</code></li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">jQuery selectors - I only used the id selector. I kept my design
                        simple.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Wireframe - I knew my design was going to be simple. I wireframed
                        directly in <code>html</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h4>Where are the comments?</h4>
            <p>I didnt write any comments. Typically I try to write my code in a human readable format using
                descriptive variable and function names. As the code changes over time comments quickly become out of
                date and can be totally incorrect. As such, comments are best saved for complicated code or business
                logic and used sparingly. I understand that in this class I need to go back and add comments in to
                explain my thought process. I will do so in a later commit.</p>
            <h4>What next?</h4>
            <p>Using my builder to write the blog post actually proved really useful. It saved me a considerable amount
                of time. Looking ahead in the course syllabus I can see several opportunities to improve upon it.
                Adding a DB backend to save/load instead of import/export would be really nice. I want to add in a
                feature that will allow me to rearrange each element as I go. This way I could go back and insert a
                picture or change the order of elements. Finally, I would like to write a <code>JavaScript</code> file
                that can parse my export <code>JSON</code>. That would remove the manual setup of copying the raw
                output over to my blog post <code>html</code> file. </p>
            <h4>Merge me in, Scotty!</h4>
            <p>I'm getting the hang of this whole command line thing. Here is how easy the merge was starting from my
                final commit.</p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "My message"
$ git push origin homework2
$ git checkout master
$ git merge homework2
$ git push origin master
</code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>It worked like a charm first time.</p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>Once git is setup, its quite easy to work with. That initial setup can be a pain though. The JS/jQuery
                stuff was easy because I have done a lot of it before. I had a lot of fun making it though. I am very
                pleased with my final product. It does exactly what i need it to do and I will continue to use it for
                my blog posts throughout the term. The biggest reason I wanted to build it is because chrome has built
                in spell check in text boxes. Now i don't have to copy and past my paragraphs between word and VSCode!
                While I consider this weeks assignment code complete I will continue to make some tweaks throughout the
                week. Those tweaks will not be covered on this post but can be viewed in my commit history. That's it
                for this week.</p>
