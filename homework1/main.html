            <h4>The Goals</h4>
            <p>
                This assignment we are to become familiar with Git using the command line. In order to get there we are
                to create a new repo using the command line. After that we will build a static website to demonstrate
                our ability to use HTML/CSS and bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting with the repo will allow me to make commits as I put together my static page. I'll have a
                chance to practice my command line skills. Lets begin.
            </p>
            <h4>So We Begin</h4>

            <p>
                First up I navigated to my folder where I want each of my homework repos to live. Then I created a
                folder, initialized my repo and marked the folder so it would be picked up by the initial commit.
            </p>
            <div>
                <pre><code>
                            $ cd Documents/CS460/
                            $ mkdir Homework1
                            $ cd Homework1
                            $ git init
                            $ git add .
                    </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Once that was done I headed over to GitHub to see what I needed to do to create a repo and set it as my
                origin. I already knew that I wanted to use SSH authentication so first I used
                <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/">GitHubs
                    SSH key guide</a>
                to create a local key. Then I added it to my account. I know that i setup my SSH agent incorrectly
                because each command that goes to GitHub requires me to enter my passphrase. I had enough of a headache
                just getting this far that I decided to tackle that monster another day.
            </p>
            <h4>The First Mistake</h4>

            <div>
                <pre><code>
                            $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
                            $ git remote add origin git@github.com:zknowleswou/Homework1.git
                            $ git push origin master
                            $ ERROR!! -> Created an empty text file
                    </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>
                Time to set my GitHub repo as the origin. I will be following this <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/">GitHub
                    guide</a> to add my local repo. While following the guide I ran into an issue; <code>git push origin master</code>
                resulted in the following: <code>error: src refspec master does not match any</code>. A quick
                search revealed that the error was a result of having nothing to commit. Looks like my guide may have
                lead me astray. The fix was easy enough. I created an empty text file and added it to my initial
                commit. The next push went off without a hitch.
            </p>
            <h4>The Repo Is Ready</h4>

            <div>
                <pre><code>
                            $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
                            $ git push origin master
                    </code></pre>
            </div>
            <p>With my repo setup and accepting pushes it was time to become a <a href="https://hackertyper.net/">hacker
                    typer</a> and put together my
                static site. My slightly esoteric subject is the Japanese hobby called Gunpla.</p>

            <h4>We're Gonna Need A Montage...</h4>

            <h4>A Few Hours Later...</h4>

            <p>
                After navigating back and forth between Gunpla reference material, the bootstrap component guide, image
                croppers, VS code and git bash I completed my static website. The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/zknowleswou/Homework1">here</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                After a final review I reviewed my work a few more times. Yet I know I've missed something. I'm not
                worried though because I know I will remember it in my sleep the night after the due date. At that
                point whats done is done so I may as well go back to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, for any typos I apologise. I wrote everything in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in order to save
                myself some time. I would promise to write all my copy in Word so that I can spell check it in the
                future, however, life does not always give me that sort of time.
